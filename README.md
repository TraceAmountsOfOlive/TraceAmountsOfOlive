Wow, gotta say I didn't expect something like this from GitHub, haha. Makes it feel like a social network of some sort, which depending on your usecase might not be entirely innacurate? Anyways, I'm Olive! Nice to meet you. Uhh, I like writing code? I don't ever really know what to write on bios for *standard* websites, much less here.
